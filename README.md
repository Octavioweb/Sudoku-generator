# Sudoku-generator

Simple python algorithm to generate a NxN size sudoku. Recursivity applied. 

## Introduction

This is a simple python code that prints in the terminal a sudoku. It generates the boarg using a simple recursive function.

## How to use

Simply change the name of the variable **size** to the desired board size. This number must be a number such that it must have a integer square root. For example, the numbers 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, etc..

The code first generates the board, and finally prints it in a sudoku-format.
